# First_Program

This is the first program I can remember having written on my own. I made it somewhere around 4th or 5th grade, in scratch. 

The program finds the square root of any number using very naive successive approximation. It begins with a guess: half the number, then squares guess and compares it to the target number. Depending on whether the guess squared it too big or small, it changes the upper or lower bound and assigns a new guess.
